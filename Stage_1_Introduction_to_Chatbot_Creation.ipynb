        "#### Stage 1: Introduction to Conversational AI/Chatbot Creation\n",
        "\n",
        " - Welcome to the beginning of an immersive journey into the realm of conversational AI. This single-stage project aims to give you hands-on experience developing a basic yet functional chatbot that can interact with users and respond to queries using a pre-defined knowledge base. Your voyage into this exciting field of AI will be one marked by discovery, learning, and application of theoretical concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        " - In this first stage, we will create a simple chatbot with the following objectives:\n",
        "    -  1. Initial Greeting: Start by greeting the user and inviting them to ask questions.\n",
        "    - 2. Input Reception: Be able to accept user input in the form of a question or a statement.\n",
        "    - 3. Input Processing: Be capable of processing the user's input.\n",
        "    - 4. Formulate a Response: Based on the processed input, the chabot searches its predefined knowledge base for an appropriate response. The chatbot should formulate a reply if the knowledge base contains an answer.\n",
        "    - 5. Output a Response: Should output the formulated response back to the user, completing one cycle of interaction as well as be prepared to accept a follow-up question or a new question from the user.\n",
        "    - 6. Handle Unknown Queries: If a user's query doesn't match anything in the chatbot's knowledge base, it should have a default response indicating that it doesn't know the answer.\n",
        "    - 7. Testing and Iterating\n",
        "\n",
        "  So let's embark on this exciting adventure, and who knows, the chatbot you develop might just be the next big thing in A"
